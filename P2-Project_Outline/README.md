# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project is going to be a medical app primarily for doctors and other medical professionals to use to keep track of their appointments, patients, patient information, and other related resources so they can keep up on all of their patient needs.
### Features
Features will include the ability for patients to set up appointments, will give doctors the ability to look at patient information, note prescribed medications, and keep notes for patient records.
### Technologies
Technologies will include IntelliJ, Thymeleaf, Bootsrap, CSS, DTOs, and APIs.
### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll have to learn a lot more about databases and how to pull information from databases as I feel like LC101 didn't spend enough time on database interaction within actual code to really be effective.
